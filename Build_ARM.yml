# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# Sample YAML file to validate and export an ARM template into a build artifact
# Requires a package.json file located in the target repository

trigger:
- main #collaboration branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:

# Installs Node and the npm packages saved in your package.json file in the build

- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: 'install'
    workingDir: './' #replace with the package.json folder
    verbose: true
  displayName: 'Install npm package'

# Validates all of the Data Factory resources in the repository. You'll get the same validation errors as when "Validate All" is selected.
# Enter the appropriate subscription and name for the source factory.

- task: Npm@1
  inputs:
    command: 'custom'
    workingDir: './' #replace with the package.json folder

  displayName: 'Validate'

# Validate and then generate the ARM template into the destination folder, which is the same as selecting "Publish" from the UX.
# The ARM template generated isn't published to the live version of the factory. Deployment should be done by using a CI/CD pipeline. 

- task: Npm@1
  inputs:

#For using preview that allows you to only stop/ start triggers that are modified, please comment out the above line and uncomment the below line. Make sure the package.json contains the build-preview command.
